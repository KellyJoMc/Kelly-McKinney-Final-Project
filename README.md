# Kelly McKinney Final Project

This repository includes files and code for my Entitiy Academy final project on chess games. Using data from 20,000 games on the website lichess.org, I performed a variety of analyses and developed a machine learning model to predict a game's winner. 

The project required some data wrangling, inlcuding recoding some columns from string to numeric, creatiion of additional variables, and dummy coding. I also subsetted the data into new datasets for some analyses. You can find my data wrangling file here: (https://github.com/KellyJoMc/Kelly-McKinney-Final-Project/blob/main/FinalProject_DataWrangling.ipynb)

I conducted anlayses to find the most frequent winner, the most frequent game result, and the most frequently used opening moves. I also seperated players into rating categories of beginner, intermediate, and advanced, and then determined the most frequently used opening moves by each category. I then looked at which opening moves most often resulted in a white win and which most often resulted in a black win. I also performed a few other simple analyses. The visuals I created can be found here: https://github.com/KellyJoMc/Kelly-McKinney-Final-Project/blob/main/ChessVisuals.ipynb

I then created a machine learning model to predict the winner. My most accurate model has an accuracy of 72% and can be found here: (https://github.com/KellyJoMc/Kelly-McKinney-Final-Project/blob/main/MachineLearning_RandomForest2.ipynb)

Additional analyses (chi-squares, logistic regression models), can be found here: (https://github.com/KellyJoMc/Kelly-McKinney-Final-Project/blob/main/Chi-Squares.ipynb) and here: (https://github.com/KellyJoMc/Kelly-McKinney-Final-Project/blob/main/Logistic%20Regression.ipynb)

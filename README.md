# Kelly McKinney Final Project
Files and code for my Entitiy Academy final project on chess games.



Using data from 20,000 games on the website lichess.org, I performed a variety of analyses and developed a machine learning model to predict a game's winner. 

You can find my data wrangling file here: (https://github.com/KellyJoMc/Kelly-McKinney-Final-Project/blob/main/FinalProject_DataWrangling.ipynb)

My random forest machine learning analysis and model can be found here: (https://github.com/KellyJoMc/Kelly-McKinney-Final-Project/blob/main/MachineLearning_RandomForest2.ipynb)

Additional analyses (chi-squares, logistic regression models), can be found here: (https://github.com/KellyJoMc/Kelly-McKinney-Final-Project/blob/main/Chi-Squares.ipynb) and here: (https://github.com/KellyJoMc/Kelly-McKinney-Final-Project/blob/main/Logistic%20Regression.ipynb)
